            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p>I started by career with Citrix Systems working on kernel modules. 
              After that, I worked on my own startup building options trading infrastructure. 
              Post that, I took up backend engginnering roles with Proptiger and Moonfrog. 
              Lately, I worked as an engineering manager for Moonfrog in one of their game teams</p>
            <p>This page gives a very high level summary of my career so far. Please get in touch with me if a detailed resume is needed.</p>

                <h2>Moonfrog Labs</h3>
                <p class="time-range">September 2016 - December 2020</p>
                <p> I joined Moonfrog as a senior software engineer in their data analytics team. 
                  I worked on scaling the in-house ETL pipeline and developing the data-warehousing infra. 
                  My role started as an individual contributor and later evolved into a team lead as the team grew.</p>
                  <p> I left Moonfrog after 1.5 years to evaluate the interest & feasibility of persuing a doctorate. 
                    After more serious consideration and research, it turned out a doctorate was not the right path for me.</p>
                <p>I joined Moonfrog back, after three months of break, to work on their flagship game TeenPattiGold. 
                  I joined as a senior engineer and then went on to take up larger responsibilities as an engineering manager for the same team. 
                  As an EM, my role aimed at being an efficient bridge between product and engineering, focussing primarily on execution, processes and hiring.
                  </p>
                  <p>I was in this role for about 2.5 years and left in Dec-2020 to persue my own venture.

                <p> At Exarb we build an end-to-end trading system aimed at FNO arbitrage in NSE market. 
                  Products aimed at BSE-Currency market and BSE Market-Making were also developed as part of a complete suite.
                  This whole suite was developed in an exclusive partnership with an institutional trading firm 
                  and was profitable from the day of its launch</p>

                <p>I joined Citrix as in their flagship product team NetScaler - Load Balancing. 
                  As an entry level engineer, I ended up fixing a lot of bugs and then some more bugs. Fixing bugs is literally, all I did for an entire year. </p>
                  <p>Once I got the hang of things I worked on command validation framework for devices operating in a cluster
                  and on extending the GSLB (Global Server Load Balancing) statistics aggregation functionality from 
                  aggregation on single box to aggregation for a cluster of devices</p>
